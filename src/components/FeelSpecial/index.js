            I understand gaming is nice, it's great even but I want to put this out there, itâ€™s not the act of gaming but the in-betweens that we spend together as strangers-turned-friends. Can we romantacise this like we do with playing sports and cooking together because if there's one this I have learned here is that Blank has always been about developing trust, sharing common interests, and working together as friends, but most importantly growing together.

            Where there was a 'blank' canvas is now a second home to all of us; both our safe space, and our biggest adventure.
